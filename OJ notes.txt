**Some notes for OJ**

How are orders going to be managed / processed by the program?

order contains an arraylist of orderedMenuItems

pass arrayList of menuItemsOrdered to the constructor

create order in menu class

once constructed

restaurant will aggregate all types of orders together
restaurant will show / have method to return full list or orders that are not complete and are not cancelled

methods to return eat ins
method to return deliveries
method to return takeaway

orders are marked complete by chef or waiter
(order needs setter to mark complete)

eat in / takeaway / collection are all subclasses of order (need to create takeaway and collection)

eatin will hold reference to the table object (not the other way round)


have done today

added comments to show which classes i have @authored

created takeaway
created delivery

restaurant holds arraylst of orders
restaurant:
-   can return order array list
-   can return orders that are unfulfilled
-   can return orders placed by a specific customer (customer order history)
-   methods to return eat ins
-   method to return deliveries
-   method to return takeaway


all order types can be constructed with or without ordernotes - if without order notes is set to empty string
(consider revising how this works?)

methods to place eatinOrder, deliveryOrder, takeawayOrder

31/03/21

make methods to return menuitems == coffee
menuitem == drink
menuitem == coffee

change returnmenuitembyname method (in menu) to include a try catch for null pointer exception
remove if menuitem == null in other methods
