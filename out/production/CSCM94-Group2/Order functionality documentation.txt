How are orders going to be managed / processed by the program?

order contains an arraylist of orderedMenuItems

pass arrayList of menuItemsOrdered to the constructor

create order in menu class

once constructed

customer objects need to aggregate order history
restaurant will aggregate all types of orders together
restaurant will show / have method to return full list or orders that are not complete and are not cancelled
methods to return eat ins
method to return deliveries
method to return takeaway

orders are marked complete by chef or waiter
(order needs setter to mark complete)

eat in / takeaway / collection are all subclasses of order (need to create takeaway and collection)

eatin will hold reference to the table object (not the other way round)
